# odin-etch-a-sketch

It's a webpage to make sketches by hovering over a grid.

When you hover any square it changes its color to a random color, but when you hover it again
the color becomes darker and darker until it becomes black.

There are two buttons: one to reset the size of the grid, where you can insert a number between 1 and 100;
another one to clean the current grid without changing the size of it.

Enjoy:)
